#### Why do digital contracts the DotContract way?

Record keeping agreements is hard, especially when they're dynamic.

DotContract turns any contract into a digital repository, making recording keeping trivial.

#### What was DotContract designed for?

DotContract is a *general purpose* data repository for compliance, accounting, and governance data.

DotContracts can be used to govern anything from people in a partnership to computers in a data use agreement.

#### Is DotContract blockchain based?

No. DotContract (like git) is *not* blockchain based.

Blockchains are unsuitable and dangerous for fiduciaries and their clients. This is because the defining feature of a blockchain is its use of a crypto-economic game (viz proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, etc) to establish consensus over a massively commingled history of changes.

In contrast, DotContract (like git) is repository based, isolating the record keeping of any particular contract. DotContract only uses cryptography insofar as to authenticate and authorize users and their actions.

#### Is DotContract a smart contract system?

Smart contracts are typically defined as programs on a blockchain. Since a DotContract is not a program and does not live on a blockchain, we only refer to them as digital contracts.

#### Do I need to be technical to use DotContract?

Right now, yes, but user-friendly apps to interact with DotContracts are currently in-development.
