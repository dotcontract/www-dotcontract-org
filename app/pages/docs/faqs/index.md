#### Who was DotContract designed for?

DotContract is a general purpose repository for accounting, compliance, and governance data.

#### Is DotContract blockchain based?

No. DotContract (like git) is *not* blockchain based.

The defining feature of a blockchain is that it uses a crypto-economic game (viz proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, etc) to establish consensus over a history of changes. The DotContract team understands that blockchains are unsuitable and dangerous for fiduciaries and their clients.

In contrast, DotContract (again like git) is repository based. This means that DotContract simply uses cryptography to distinguish and authenticate users and their commits.
